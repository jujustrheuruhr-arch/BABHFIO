1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,936
DOOR-TO-DOOR

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,560
Please, just a penny a day...

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,400
...can purchase enough milk...

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,560
...to feed a family of four for a week.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,040
But only if you can help.
Please give as much as you can to the...

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,537
...desperate savage murderers,
who would gouge out your eyes

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,240
and cut of your tongue
for satanic rituals. On the next Geraldo.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,560
What's that address again?

9
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:37,044
These guys jam.

10
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:48,645
Kick-ass.

11
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,817
Yeah, kick-ass.

12
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:13,820
That's pretty cool.

13
00:02:20,612 --> 00:02:23,127
- He's standing on a butt.
- Yeah.

14
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,366
I like butts.

15
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:41,172
- Butts are cool.
- Yeah, I'm getting a stiffy.

16
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,408
Buttcheeks.

17
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:05,197
Look at all those butts.

18
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,373
I'm pitching a tent.

19
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:40,795
Whoa!

20
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,916
This is the 90s, people.
A 9 upside down is a 6.

21
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,456
So let's turn the
90's upside down

22
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:54,300
and we capture the spirit of the
60's, okay?

23
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,796
Watch those
flashbacks, dude.

24
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,020
Excuse me,
could I have your attention, please?

25
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,743
Okay, this week we're going to
learn a little bit about that spirit.

26
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,655
By giving of ourselves.

27
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,520
We're all going door to door
to collect for the "Consumer Goods

28
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:12,575
- For Overseas Children Fund".
- No way.

29
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,796
Of course, I can't force you
to work for charity,

30
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,000
thanks to our constitution's
delicate balance

31
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,716
between our individual liberties
and a common good.

32
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,080
Nor would I want to, because of my
own beliefs in personal freedom.

33
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:29,156
So, anyone who doesn't want to collect,
can complete the 60's project

34
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,836
by doing a book report on
"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test".

35
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,660
- Oral, oral, oral.
- Yeah.

36
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,757
Written or oral.

37
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,156
- Yes.
- Cool.

38
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,849
But first, of course, you've
got to read the book.

39
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,556
- That guy is touching his wiener.
- Yeah.

40
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,373
I'm gonna touch my wiener.

41
00:04:56,402 --> 00:05:00,319
If you're like, famous, you can
touch your wiener and nobody cares.

42
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,128
- Isn't that dude on... 9-2-0-1-0?
- Yeah.

43
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,195
- That show sucks.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:16,239
- Those chicks are stuck up.
- Yeah.

45
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:17,920
Stuck up my butt.

46
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,012
You think he knows
that everybody hates him?

47
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,279
Yeah.

48
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,375
What a wuss.

49
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,305
This video would be cool if they had,
like, chicks and tight pants everywhere.

50
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:32,079
Yeah.

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,888
- And lots of fire and explosions.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,556
And car accidents.
Then it would be cool.

53
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,918
This video is stupid.
Change it.

54
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,720
What a dork!

55
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,720
He's talking about school.

56
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,308
Hey Beavis,
do you know how to read?

57
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,826
This guy is a dumbass.

58
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:07,411
- School sucks!
- Yeah!

59
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,720
- Yes?
- Got any money?

60
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,216
We're collecting for the poor.

61
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,440
Great, I just lost my job.

62
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,296
What in the hell... What do you...
What do you want?

63
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
We're collecting for the poor.

64
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,600
- Helping 'em buy meals and stuff.
- Meals?

65
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
There is one!

66
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,976
The 60's must have sucked.

67
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,700
Maybe in this house there'll
be a beautiful chick.

68
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,520
Hello? Collecting for charity.

69
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,400
Help the poor.

70
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,920
Come in, boys.
I've been waiting for you.

71
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,720
Now, turn on the lamp.

72
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,616
- Once again boys, who do you serve?
- You, mistress Cora.

73
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,680
- Whose wrath do you fear?
- Yours, mistress Cora.

74
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:46,312
Yes, that Madonna book
was worth every penny.

75
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:51,207
Whoa!

76
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:00,117
Erotica.

77
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,981
- That was cool.
- Yeah.

78
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,985
Erotica.

79
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:22,908
Gotta go, dude,
got to go spank my monkey.

80
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,220
Head.

81
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,056
- These guys are cool.
- Yeah.

82
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:15,709
Head.

83
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,161
People, I'm proud to announce that
we collected more than eight dollars

84
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:31,067
- for our charity drive.
- Eight dollars? Sad, dude.

85
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,096
Yeah.

86
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,176
But what makes me especially proud

87
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,880
is this note I received from
Mrs. Cora Anthrax on Willow Place.

88
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,480
"When your charity work was explained
to me by those charming young men,

89
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:48,204
Beavis and Butt-Head,

90
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,200
my heart went out to those
poor children overseas."

91
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,736
"Good luck, and please send Beavis
and Butt-Head around if you need more."

92
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,000
And students, it's a check
for one hundred dollars.

93
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,136
I'm proud of you guys.

94
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,613
And here is your prize
for collecting

95
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:10,299
the most money in our "Spirit
of the 60's" drive.

96
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,016
A Moby Grape album for each of you.

97
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,920
You know, it hurts me to part with
these, guys. They are collectors items.

98
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,940
But giving 'till it hurts is
part of what the 60's were all about.

99
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,400
Nice catch, dude.

100
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,753
Watch this! Behind the back.

101
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:31,150
Damn!

102
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:35,621
What'd happen if you stuck a
firecracker into that little hole?

103
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,600
That would be cool.

104
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,243
Hey look, an old dude.

105
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:10,336
- This guy is a dumbass.
- Yeah, he looks like David Letterman.

106
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:15,117
Trick photography.

107
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:19,790
That's pretty cool.

108
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:21,469
Whoa.

109
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,840
- Storms are cool.
- Yeah.

110
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,814
Whoa, that's pretty cool.

111
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:52,718
Wind is cool.

112
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:56,984
Here, pony.

113
00:12:58,772 --> 00:12:59,991
That's cool.

114
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,095
Hurricanes are cool.

115
00:13:14,738 --> 00:13:17,342
I like when the wind
knocks stuff over

116
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,844
- and lands on people.
- Yeah, and it tears a roof off.
